Project Name: Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production in India

Description: This project aims to predict the age of crops in agriculture using data science and machine learning operations. By leveraging historical data on crop cultivation and production, the project seeks to provide farmers and agricultural stakeholders with valuable insights into crop growth cycles, enabling better resource allocation and decision-making.

Dataset: The dataset used for this project contains information on crop types, varieties, production quantities, seasons, costs, and recommended cultivation zones in India from 2001 to 2014. The data is sourced from https://data.gov.in/ and is fully licensed for use in this project.
